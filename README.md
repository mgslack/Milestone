# Milestone
The mileage game of Milestone (Mille Bornes)

A pretty decent game of Milestone, solo play against the computer.  A/I is pretty good
and computer does win rounds and games frequently.

This game is loosely based on a game written in basic by David Addison in
1986. It was converted to Turbo Pascal, then to Speed Pascal (OS/2 - first game I created
with voice navigation in mind), finally to C#. The engine was significantly rewritten
with the C# port to finally remove all of the GOTOs from the "pick card to play" routine.

Game is dependent on the GameStatistics and CustomMessageBox libraries and are needed if
re-compiling or builing the code.

Last updated and comppiled using VS 2019.
