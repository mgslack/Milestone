      <img id="image" alt="Milestone Game Image" src="Milestone_help.gif">
      <p>Milestone is a card game where the user plays the computer to be the first to reach 5000 points (or a
         value set via options). The game is played in a series of rounds with a round ending when the computer
         or player reaches 1000 miles or all cards have been played/discarded and there are no more cards left to
         deal out. The game was originally released in France as Mille Bornes (a thousand milestones).</p>
      <p>The round starts with each player being dealt seven cards. A random pick will select either the computer
         or the player to start the round. That player will then start playing by either playing a card or
         discarding a card. After playing, another card is dealt to the player. Then the other player will
         then do the same. These turns continue until 1000 miles is reach by one of the players or there are no
         more cards left to play/discard.</p>
      <p>The game screen is made up of the players and computers playing areas, a message line and a area with the
         current rounds mileage. Also, an area with the players cards is displayed. Each players playing area has
         six spots. There is a speed pile, a battle pile and four places for safety cards. The majority of the
         game is played by placing cards in either the players or computers battle and speed piles.</p>
      <p>This version of Milestone was based on a game originally written by David Addison on the Amiga using
         ABasic &copy;1986. Subsequently, it was rewritten for DOS using Turbo Pascal in 1989 and then rewritten
         for OS/2 using Speed Pascal/2 in 1995-1996, finally to C# in 2014.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="bold"><a id="cards">Cards</a></div>
    <div>
      <p>There are four types of cards that can be played.</>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#mileage">Mileage cards</a>
        <li><a href="#hazard">Hazard cards</a>
        <li><a href="#remedy">Remedy cards</a>
        <li><a href="#safety">Safety cards</a>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, there is one other card that does not fit within any of the four types. This is the roll
         card. This card must be played before any mileage cards can be played. It is not necessary to play this
         card before playing any of the other types of cards.</p>
      <p>All of these cards are necessary to win the round and ultimately, the game.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="bold"><a id="mileage">Mileage Cards</a></div>
    <div>
      <p>There are five mileage cards available in Milestone. These cards represent mileage totals of 25, 50, 75,
         100 and 200 miles. The higher the mileage, the better the score.</p>
      <p>If a player has a speed limit card played against them, they may only play the 25 and 50 mile cards.</p>
      <p>The player can only play mileage cards, combined with the mileage already played in the round, that does
         not exceed 1000 miles. Playing to 1000 miles ends the round.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="bold"><a id="hazard">Hazard Cards</a></div>
    <div>
      <p>There are five hazard cards that can be played. These include the Speed Limit (played on the opponents
         speed pile), Stop, Flat Tire, Accident and Out of Gas cards (played on the opponents battle pile). Each
         one of these cards has a equivalent remedy card or a safety card that must be played before any more
         mileage cards (with the exception of the Speed Limit card).</p>
      <p>The hazard cards cannot be played against an opponent unless they have a Roll card played. In addition,
         if the opponent has the appropriate safety card, the hazard card cannot be played.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="bold"><a id="remedy">Remedy Cards</a></div>
    <div>
      <p>Milestone has four remedy type cards that can be played. Each remedy card is played against a specific
         hazard. The remedy cards include End Speed Limit, Spare Tire, Repairs and Gas. In addition, the Stop
         hazard is cancelled by playing another Roll card. After playing a remedy card, the player must then play
         a roll card to continue playing mileage cards. The exception is the End Speed Limit card. This card is
         played on the Speed pile and not on the battle pile.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="bold"><a id="safety">Safety Cards</a></div>
    <div>
      <p>Safety cards are played on one of the four safety places of the player playing them. They prevent a
         player from getting stopped by the corresponding hazard card for the balance of the current round.  
         As soon as a safety is played, it prevents any further hazard of that type and cancels any hazard
         in place.</p>
      <p>There are four safety cards. There are only four of these cards in the deck (one of each).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Right of Way Card - When this card is played in the players safety area, the opponent cannot play a
            Stop card on the battle pile of the player who played this card. In addition, a speed limit card
            cannot be played on the speed pile of the player who played the Right of Way card. This card will also
            cancel any stop or speed limit cards already played and sets the No Speed Limit and Roll cards
            automatically. It is probably the most powerful safety card available.
        <li>Extra Tank Card - When this card is played, no more Out of Gas cards can be played against the player
            who played it. This card also cancels any Out of Gas cards currently played against the player who
            played it.
        <li>Permanent Tire Card - When this card is played, no more Flat Tire cards can be played against the
            player who played this card. In addition, any Flat Tires are cancelled if played against the player
            before this card is played.
        <li>Driving Ace Card - When this card is played, no more Accident cards can be played against the player
            who played this card. Also, any accident card played against the player who played this card is cancelled.
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="bold"><a id="score">Score</a></div>
    <div>
      <p>At the round end, each player scores 1 point for every mile driven. There are several other ways to make
         points.</p>
      <ul>
        <li id="linone"><div id="bold">Other points:</div>
        <li>100 points - Each safety card played.
        <li>300 points - Each <a href="#coupfourre">coup fourre</a>.
        <li id="linone"><div id="bold">Bonus points:</div>
        <li>400 points - Making 1000 mile points.
        <li>500 points - Mileage shut out (opponent didn't play any mileage cards).
      </ul>
      <p>The maximum score that can be had for any round is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1000 - points for mileage.
        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;400 - points for making 1000 miles.
        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;500 - points for preventing your opponent from playing any mileage.
        <li>1200 - points for 4 coup fourres.
        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;400 - points for playing the 4 safety cards.
        <li>------
        <li>3500 - total points.
      </ul>
      <p>The game is played in a series of rounds until 5000 or more points is made. If both the
         computer and player get above the game winning point total and the score is tied, the
         player wins the game.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="bold"><a id="coupfourre">Coup Fourre</a></div>
    <div>
      <p>A Coup Fourre is when a safety card is played by a player who has the corresponding hazard card played
         against them. This special play not only cancels the hazard, but scores more points.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>For more information on Milestone and its rules, see the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille_Bornes">Milestone</a> entry on Wikipedia.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="bold"><a id="controls">Controls</a></div>
    <div>
      <p>The game controls should be relatively easy to figure out. The player can select
         the 'New Game' or if a game is already started, the 'New Round', 'Help', 'Options'
         or 'Exit' buttons at any time. If a round or game is not yet completed and the
         'New Game/Round' button is pressed, the player is asked to confirm. Likewise, if
         the 'Exit' button is pressed while a game is in progress, the player will be asked
         to confirm the selection.</p>
      <p>During game play, when it is the players turn, the player can select either the
         'Play' or 'Discard' buttons under each one of their cards. These buttons are not
         enabled when it is not the players turn or there is no card to play or discard in
         that spot.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="bold"><a id="options">Options</a></div>
    <div>
      <p>There are a few options that can be set to customize the game play experience.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Points Needed to Win Game - The total points needed to win the game. Default is
            5000 points. The range is between 2500 and 50000.
        <li>Incidental Game Sounds On - If checked (the default), various beeps and other
            sounds are played during certain events. If not checked, these sounds are not
            heard.
        <li>Players Always Starts Round - If checked, the player will always start each new
            round. If not checked (the default), a random roll determines if the computer or
            the player will start each round.
